# SalesManProblem
In this repository I'll post the different Graph Algorithms I've developed to solve the famous Sales Man Problem in the fastest way possible.
The algorithms developed in this project are: 
- Greedy
- Backtracking Greedy
- Backtracking
- Branch and Bound (3 different heuristics)

You can find the complete project with all the files needed to execute the different algorithms developed in the following link: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1wzP579ZoC1jHY1M27SKo8WEPTbBXcnbk?usp=sharing
